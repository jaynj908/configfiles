## JTL Dark Theme by Jay Lynch
This is my first theme. Its a simple theme I customized for Python.
There will be probably a few more edits to get the colors the way I really need them.

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux)
* Toggle preview (`Shift+CMD+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux)
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets

**Enjoy!**
